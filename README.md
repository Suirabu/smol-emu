# SmolEmu

Smol is a retro-inspired fantasy game console.
This repository contains the source code for the Smol emulator,
a program which allows you to play Smol games directly on your computer.

## Quick Start

Build SmolEmu

```sh
$ make
```

Install SmolEmu

```sh
# make install
```

Play a game!

```sh
$ ./bin/smol-emu <ROM path>

# Or, if you've already installed SmolEmu locally...
$ smol-emu <ROM path>
```

## Contributing

Bug fixes and patches are welcome and would be greatly appreciated.
I will not be accepting PRs containing feature additions or major changes to the functionality of the emulator at this time.

## License
