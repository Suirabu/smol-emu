| sub         | 0x21   | a b -- c       | Pushes the result of subtracting the top-most value on the stack from the value below it onto the stack. |
| mult        | 0x22   | a b -- c       | Pushes the result of multiplying the two top-most values on the stack together onto the stack. |

| not         | 0x32   | a b -- c       | Performs a bitwise-not operation on values `a` and `b`, pushing the result of the operation to the top of the stack. |
| xor         | 0x33   | a b -- c       | Performs a bitwise-xor operation on values `a` and `b`, pushing the result of the operation to the top of the stack. |
| shiftl      | 0x34   | a n -- c       | Shifts bits in value `a` to the left `n` times, pushing the result of the operation to the top of the stack. |
| shiftr      | 0x35   | a n -- c       | Shifts bits in value `a` to the right `n` times, pushing the result of the operation to the top of the stack. |
